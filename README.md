# FSync
Folder Sync Application
This application is a Folder Syncronization Program that Uses a host directory to sync between others.
When is syncs the files, it does it both to and from the host directory. This was made to be used on a
user's computer and when a phone or flashdrive would be plugged in, it would check the preset directories.
The directories are not drive letter dependent (With the exception of the Host Directory)
So it will recognize and check the devices that are shown to be available.
This application is a single EXE file and will create 2 files, one for the host directory, the other for the list of other directories.
